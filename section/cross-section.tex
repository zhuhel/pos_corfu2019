The fiducial cross-section for the production of inclusive $ZZjj$ is measured in each channel, following the formula $\sigma = (N_{\mathrm{data}} - N_{\mathrm{bkg}}) / (L \times C)$,
where $N_{\mathrm{data}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{bkg}}$ refer to the number of events in data and expected background events, respectively, and $L$ refers to the integrated luminosity.
% and $C$ is the correction factor calculated as the ratio of the number of $ZZjj$ events passing the detector-level event selection to the number of events selected in the fiducial volume.
The $C$-factors are found to be ($69.9 \pm 0.3(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 1.2(\mathrm{theo}) \pm 2.8(\mathrm{exp})$)\% in the \lllljj channel,
and ($21.6 \pm 0.3(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.8(\mathrm{theo}) \pm 0.8(\mathrm{exp})$)\% in the \llvvjj channel.
The small $C$-factor in the \llvvjj channel is due to the large event migration effect,
where events passing the \met-significance requirement at detector-level could have a soft \met at particle-level.
The measured and predicted fiducial cross-sections are presented in Table~\ref{tab:xs}.
The measured cross-section has a total uncertainty of 11\% (29\%) in the \lllljj (\llvvjj) channel, and is found to be compatible with the SM prediction.
The data statistical uncertainty is dominating, while the experimental uncertainties relating to jet energy scale and resolution and the background estimations are the major systematic uncertainties in the \lllljj and \llvvjj channels, respectively.
