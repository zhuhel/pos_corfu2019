This presentation summarizes the search for electroweak production of two jets in association with a $Z$-boson pair using the \llll and \llvv~decay final states of the two $Z$ bosons. The search uses 139 \ifb~of 13 \TeV~$pp$ collision data collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. In the optimised fiducial regions, the cross-sections for inclusive $ZZjj$ production are measured, with a total relative uncertainty of 11\% (28\%) for the \lllljj~(\llvvjj) channel, and found to be compatible with the SM predictions.
The search for electroweak production of two jets in association with a $Z$-boson pair is based on multivariate discriminants trained separately in each channel to enhance the separation between the signal and backgrounds. Combining both the \lllljj~and \llvvjj~channels, the background-only hypothesis is rejected with an observed (expected) significance of 5.5 (4.3) $\sigma$.
This gives the first observation of electroweak production of two jets in association with a $Z$-boson pair.
The measured cross-section for electroweak production in the fiducial region is $0.82\pm0.21$ fb,
corresponding to a signal strength of $1.35\pm0.34$, in agreement with the SM prediction.
